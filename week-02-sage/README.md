# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
[SAGE is a Study Assistant & Guide Engine, which is a customized personalized AI learning companion.]

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
[-It will help with keeping track of the what worked and what did not work as far as prompts.
- Help when I need a better understanding of things. 
- And when I am having trouble with something i can ask for help to help brainstorm or troubleshoot the issue.]

## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: [Claude] - [I like the way claude repsonds giving a little extra explantation at times which i find useful]
- **Secondary**: [ChatGPT] - [When I need a bit more direct answer with out the extra fluff.]
- **For Special Tasks**: [Gemni would be useful when needing another brainstorming ideas.]

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
[ - Use it to learn not just give answers.
 - Ask questions with details of why as well.
 - Verify that the response is acturate and not blindly copy-paste.
 - Give credit to the AI when used for collaborations.]
