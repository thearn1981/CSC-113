# H.1.2 — Continuing with SAGE (Track A: Code Builders)

**Course:** CSC-113 AI Fundamentals  
**Assignment:** H.1.2 – Track A (Coder Track)  
**Due Date:** Feb 9, 11:59 PM  
**Submission Method:** GitHub Pull Request (PR #3)

---

## 📌 Track Selection

For this assignment, I am completing **Track A: Code Builders**.

Track A focuses on AI-assisted software development, which aligns with my interest in programming and learning how AI tools can support real-world coding workflows. This track emphasizes building, coding, and documenting AI collaboration rather than relying only on prompt-based outputs.

## 🎯 Assignment Goals

The goal of H.1.2 is to move beyond AI comparison and begin using AI as an active development partner. This assignment introduces a professional development workflow used by software developers.

By completing this track, I am practicing:

- Setting up a **GitHub Codespace** as a cloud-based development environment
- Writing **Python scripts** with AI assistance
- Organizing files in a **SAGE workspace**
- Using the **Issue → Branch → Code → Pull Request** workflow
- Documenting how AI contributes to the coding process

---

## 🛠 What This Repository Includes

- A working **GitHub Codespace**
- Python scripts created with AI support
- Organized project files following SAGE workspace guidelines
- Documentation describing how AI was used during development
- A Pull Request (PR #2) demonstrating completed work

---

## 🤝 AI Collaboration

AI tools were used as a coding partner to:
- Help generate starter code
- Explain Python concepts
- Assist with debugging and refinement
- Provide guidance on project structure and workflow

All code and decisions were reviewed and adjusted to ensure understanding and correctness.
