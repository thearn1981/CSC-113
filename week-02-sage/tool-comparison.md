## Comparative Analysis
[All three AI tools responded relatively quickly to each prompt. For the first prompt, ChatGPT’s response was clear but brief. Claude provided a more detailed definition, offering additional explanation beyond what ChatGPT included. Gemini explained how it arrived at its response and cited sources, while still keeping the answer short and to the point.
For the haiku prompt, each AI generated a quick and creative response. All of them would be helpful for brainstorming if someone finds themselves stuck.
When asked to use a specific format, each AI produced its own version of a comparison table. I preferred Claude’s response because it not only presented the comparisons clearly but also summarized the key differences at the end.
For the final prompt, all three AI tools provided similar outlines for learning GitHub. However, Claude stood out by including helpful tips that would be especially useful for beginners still learning GitHub.
Overall, if I needed a direct answer with no extra detail, I would choose ChatGPT. If I wanted more explanation and guidance, I would lean toward Claude.
