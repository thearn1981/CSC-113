- [x] Verified Python installation

- [x] Created and tested `prompt_tracker.py`
- [X] All scripts run without errors

## Issues Encountered
[I waited until I was in the codespace to make the branch and switch to it, so I needed
copilots help with the proper commands to make that happen. After that it was smooth.]
