#### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date**: [01/19/2026]

**What I learned this week:**
- [AI is a cool tool and each one seems to be a little more detailed then others.]
- [Learn to be specific as if you are explaining stuff to a 5 year old.]
- [Having a back up AI tool for once you hit the limit is important.]

**What challenged me:**
- [When you are not specific about somethings, the AI may just assume things.]

**What I'm proud of:**
- [Learning to be more specfic with prompts]

**Questions I still have:**
- [Is one really better then the other?]
